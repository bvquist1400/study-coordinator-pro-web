# Study Coordinator Pro - Development Project Instructions (Revised)

## Project Overview
You are helping develop "Study Coordinator Pro," a **web-first application** designed as a personal productivity tool for clinical research coordinators. This is a **completely new project** built from scratch to optimize coordinator workflows, while maintaining the ability to reference patterns from an existing IP Accountability System.

## Strategic Development Approach

### Fresh Start Architecture
- **Clean slate development** - New repository and codebase optimized for coordinators from day one
- **Reference existing IP system** - Extract specific algorithms and patterns as needed without inheriting complexity
- **Coordinator-focused design** - Every feature built specifically for coordinator workflows
- **Separate project maintainability** - Keep IP Accountability System intact for future use

### Web-First Strategy (Updated from Mobile-First)
- **Primary platform**: Responsive web application with mobile-first design
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities for app-like experience
- **Cross-platform by default** - Works on phones, tablets, desktops without separate development
- **Future native apps** only if market validation justifies the investment

## Target User
**Primary User**: Clinical Research Coordinators at pharmaceutical research sites
- Manage 2-8 active clinical studies simultaneously
- Responsible for patient visits, compliance tracking, deviation management, and monitor interactions
- Currently use paper logs, Excel spreadsheets, and basic clinical software
- Looking for personal productivity tools to save 1-2 hours per week
- **Device usage**: Mix of desktop work (detailed data entry), tablet use (patient visits), and mobile access (quick updates)

## Core Value Proposition
"The Swiss Army knife for clinical research coordinators" - a comprehensive personal productivity tool that organizes daily clinical research tasks without replacing regulatory record-keeping systems.

## Technical Foundation (Revised)
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.5.2 + Supabase + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Turbopack
- **Architecture**: Web-first SaaS with mobile-responsive design
- **Database**: Fresh Supabase schema designed specifically for coordinator workflows
- **Component Strategy**: Extract and adapt specific components/logic from existing IP system as needed
- **Deployment**: Web application with PWA capabilities

- **TypeScript throughout** for maintainability and developer experience
- **Component-driven architecture** for reusability and testing

### Regulatory Positioning (Unchanged)
- **Personal productivity tool** - NOT a replacement for official regulatory records
- **Workflow optimization** - helps organize daily tasks more efficiently  
- **Supplemental system** - works alongside existing site procedures
- **Clear disclaimers** - "For workflow optimization only, does not replace regulatory requirements"

## Business Model (Updated Timeline)
- **Freemium SaaS**: 30-day free trial, then $12.99/month individual or $9.99/month team plans
- **Faster validation**: Web-first approach enables quicker user acquisition and testing
- **Revenue goal**: $500 MRR within 3 months, $1,000 MRR within 6 months, $5,000 MRR within 12 months
- **Lower customer acquisition cost** - No app store barriers, easier sharing and trials

## Component Extraction Strategy from IP System

### What TO Extract and Adapt
- **Compliance calculation algorithms** - Core mathematical logic for drug compliance
- **Authentication patterns** - User login/logout flows and session management concepts
- **Database schema patterns** - Audit trails, user roles, clinical data modeling approaches
- **UI component patterns** - Status indicators, form layouts, clinical workflow designs
- **Validation logic** - Clinical data validation rules and error handling

### What NOT to Bring Over
- **Full inventory management complexity** - Coordinators don't need full IP tracking
- **Complex integrations** - Start simple, add integrations later if needed
- **Legacy technical debt** - Clean slate allows modern best practices
- **Unused features** - Many IP features aren't relevant to coordinator productivity
- **Outdated dependencies** - Fresh project uses latest versions of everything

## Development Approach (Updated)

### Iterative Web Development
- **2-week development sprints** with working features each iteration
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core web functionality first, PWA features second
- **Component-first development** - Build reusable UI components for clinical workflows
- **Real coordinator testing** - Beta test with actual coordinators from week 8 onward

### Reference-Based Development
- **Keep IP system running** - No changes to existing production system
- **Extract specific components** when building similar features
- **Adapt rather than copy** - Optimize extracted logic for coordinator-specific needs
- **Document extraction decisions** - Track what was reused vs rebuilt for future reference

## Success Metrics (Updated Timeline)
- **Week 8**: Functional MVP with compliance calculator and visit planning
- **Week 12**: Beta users actively testing with feedback integration
- **Month 4**: 50+ active trial users, 25% trial-to-paid conversion rate
- **Month 6**: $1,000 MRR, 60% monthly retention rate
- **Month 12**: $5,000 MRR, feature expansion based on user feedback

## Communication Style (Updated)
When discussing this project:
- **Assume coordinator workflow expertise** but focus on web-first solutions
- **Reference IP system** as inspiration, not as a constraint
- **Prioritize web/PWA features** over native app complexity initially  
- **Consider cross-device usage** - coordinators switch between desktop, tablet, mobile
- **Emphasize clean development** - fresh start allows modern best practices
- **Balance feature extraction** - reuse proven logic but avoid inheriting complexity

## Key Questions for Web-First Approach
- How can we make the web interface as fast and responsive as a native app?
- What PWA features would provide the most value for coordinators?
- How do we optimize for both desktop data entry and mobile quick access?
- Which IP system components provide the most value when adapted for coordinators?
- How do we ensure offline functionality works for poor connectivity sites?
- What would make coordinators choose a web app over requesting a native app?

## Outstanding Strategic Decisions
1. **IP System Integration**: Should we audit existing IP system for compliance algorithms before building from scratch?
2. **User Research Priority**: How critical is coordinator feedback before continuing feature development?
3. **Testing vs Features**: Should we implement comprehensive testing before adding more features?
4. **Feature Sequencing**: Schedule of Events vs Compliance Calculator vs Subject Management - which delivers most value first?

## Context for Technical Decisions (Updated)
- **Cross-device flexibility** - Web-first supports coordinator workflow across multiple devices
- **IT policy friendly** - Web apps typically easier to deploy in clinical research sites
- **Faster iteration** - Web deployment allows rapid feature updates and user feedback
- **Component reusability** - Extract proven patterns from IP system while building clean architecture
- **Progressive enhancement** - Start with core web functionality, add PWA features for app-like experience

You should approach all development decisions through the lens of creating a web-first tool that clinical research coordinators would actually use daily, while strategically leveraging proven components from the existing IP Accountability System to accelerate development.
