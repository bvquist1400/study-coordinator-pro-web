  - Local labs completion tracking
- **Automatic compliance calculation** based on tablets dispensed/returned and time periods
- **Real-time compliance indicators** (color-coded percentages)

## API Infrastructure Features

### âœ… Production-Ready Server-Side Operations
- **Comprehensive REST API** with full CRUD operations for studies, visit schedules, and subject visits
- **Server-side Supabase client** with service role for secure database operations
- **JWT authentication** on all endpoints with user session validation
- **Row-level security enforcement** ensuring users only access their own data

### âœ… API Endpoints
- **Studies API** (`/api/studies`) - Study management operations
- **Visit Schedules API** (`/api/visit-schedules`) - Schedule of Events persistence
- **Subject Visits API** (`/api/subject-visits`) - Visit card accountability data
- **Individual resource routes** (`/api/[resource]/[id]`) - Specific record operations

### âœ… Security & Performance Benefits
- **Reduced client bundle size** - Less database code on frontend
- **Enhanced security** - Sensitive operations protected by server-side auth
- **Better error handling** - Consistent API responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Scalable architecture** - Ready for caching, rate limiting, and monitoring
- **Request validation** - Data type conversion and field validation

## Compliance Calculator Module

### âœ… Advanced Compliance Analysis Engine
- **Drug Compliance Calculations:**
  - Tablet accountability tracking (dispensed vs returned)
  - Multiple dosing frequencies (QD, BID, TID, QID)
  - Over/under-compliance detection with automatic alerts
  - Protocol deviation flagging with severity levels
- **Visit Timing Compliance:**
  - Visit window adherence monitoring
  - Early/late visit detection with protocol window validation
  - Missed visit identification and tracking
- **Overall Compliance Scoring:**
  - Weighted compliance averages (drug 70%, visit 30%)
  - Color-coded status indicators (excellent/good/acceptable/poor)
  - Configurable thresholds per study

### âœ… Visual Components & UI
- **ComplianceDashboard** - Full-featured monitoring interface with filtering
- **ComplianceWidget** - Embeddable status displays with details
- **ComplianceIndicator** - Status dots and progress bars
- **VisitCard Integration** - Real-time compliance feedback during data entry
- **Dedicated /compliance page** - Study-wide and subject-specific analysis

### âœ… Technical Features
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 11+ test cases covering edge cases
- **Dark theme integration** - Consistent with app design
- **Responsive design** - Works across desktop/tablet/mobile
- **Real-time calculations** - Instant compliance updates
- **Robust error handling** - Graceful fallbacks and validation

## Scalability Assessment (9.5/10)

### âœ… Strong Foundation
- **Modern stack** with Next.js 15 + Supabase + TypeScript
- **Scalable database** with proper indexing and RLS
- **Production-ready** architecture for hundreds-thousands of users
- **Clean codebase** with component-driven design

### ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Recommendations

**Immediate (1-2 months):**
- âœ… **API routes for server-side database operations** - COMPLETED
- **Error boundaries and logging** - IN PROGRESS
- **State management solution** (Zustand/Redux)

**Medium-term (2-6 months):**
- **Caching layer** (React Query/TanStack Query) 
- **Performance monitoring** and analytics
- **Advanced authentication** (2FA, SSO)

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- **Advanced caching strategies** (Redis, CDN)
- **Microservices consideration** for high-scale operations
- **Real-time features** (WebSocket connections)

## Technical Excellence
- **TypeScript throughout** for type safety and maintainability
- **Component-driven architecture** for reusability
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Production-ready API infrastructure** with server-side operations
- **Comprehensive security** - JWT auth, RLS, input validation
- **Real-time validation** and error handling
- **Comprehensive testing** with Jest and React Testing Library

## Regulatory Compliance
- **Personal productivity tool** - NOT regulatory record replacement
- **Supplemental system** working alongside existing procedures
- **Clear disclaimers** about regulatory limitations

## Business Model
**SaaS**: $12.99/month individual, $9.99/month team plans with 30-day trials

## Development Approach
**2-week sprints** with component-first development and progressive enhancement.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Testing framework** setup (Jest, React Testing Library)
2. **API routes** for server-side operations
3. **Error boundaries** and logging implementation
4. **Schedule of Events** builder completion
5. **State management** solution (Zustand recommended)

## Outstanding Research
- IP system compliance algorithm extraction
- Coordinator user research and validation
- Feature priority validation with real users

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Cross-device support** via responsive web design
- **Server-side operations** through API routes for better performance
- **Component reusability** with TypeScript interfaces
- **Progressive Web App** features for offline capability

Approach all development through the lens of creating a scalable, maintainable tool that coordinators will use daily across multiple devices.
