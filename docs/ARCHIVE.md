# Archived Reference — Study Coordinator Pro

This file preserves the previous long-form, product-oriented background that formerly lived in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` under “Archived Reference”. It includes historical context on phases, dashboards, predictive inventory write-ups, and extended architecture notes.

Why archived
- The primary developer workflow benefits from a concise, up-to-date guide.
- Detailed product background remains useful for context, but not for day-to-day engineering.

Where to look instead
- Quick dev guide: `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Onboarding/run/test: `README.md`, `TESTING.md`
- Database/RLS: `migrations/` and `database-schema.sql`

If you need the original, fully detailed text, refer to repository history prior to this archive, or migrate relevant sections here as needed for future documentation efforts.
